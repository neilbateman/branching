        <h1>cool facts about bears</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>The English word "bear" comes from Old English bera and belongs to a family of names for the bear in Germanic languages, such as Swedish björn, also used as a first name, that originate from an adjective meaning "brown". "Bear" therefore originally meant "the brown one." </li>
          <li>The family Ursidae is one of nine families in the suborder Caniformia, or "doglike" carnivorans, within the order Carnivora. Bears' closest living relatives are the pinnipeds, canids, and musteloids.</li>
          <li>The earliest members of Ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily Amphicynodontinae, including Parictis (late Eocene to early middle Miocene, 38–18 Mya) and the slightly younger Allocyon (early Oligocene, 34–30 Mya), both from North America. </li>

        <h1>cool facts about cats</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>The cat or domestic cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal.</li>
          <li>The origin of the English word cat (Old English catt) and its counterparts in other Germanic languages (such as German Katze), descended from Proto-Germanic *kattōn-, is controversial.</li>
          <li>A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder or a glaring.</li>
